# Moret Protocol

### Background

* Future and option contracts are used to hedge risk or create synthetic exposures
* In crypto world, volumes in option trading have skyrocketed in recent time:
  * Bitcoin option open interest on Deribit reached $14b on 20/10/2021, volume at $3.3b.
* There have been a couple of attempts to build decentralised option exchanges. Deribit has run a regular survey on these defi exchanges.

### Option DeFi Space

* Many protocols emerged and flourished, however the volumes are still dwarfed in comparison to Deribit
* There is limitation to capacity and product availability, with root causes in the following factors:&#x20;
  * Lack of good quality analytic data&#x20;
  * Difficulty to take on sell orders&#x20;
  * High gas fees&#x20;
  * Significant imperfect loss for liquidity providers&#x20;
  * Insufficient hedging&#x20;
  * Fat-tailed, non-normal price changes and non-stationary volatility

### Features of Moret

* On-chain oracle for historical volatility with emphasis on more recent market moves&#x20;
* On-chain hedging using 1inch and Aave on Polygon chain, benefiting from lower gas fees and slippage&#x20;
* Incentives for external bots to settle maturing option contracts&#x20;
* Constant product market maker for volatility&#x20;
* Support of issuing and redeeming tokens linked to volatilities&#x20;
* NOT a peer-to-pool model
