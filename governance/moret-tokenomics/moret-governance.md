# Moret Governance

Moret token holders can govern the entire protocol and all liquidity pools in the following ways:

1. Propose and vote on the protocol fees changed when options are exercised/expired. Initially 0.5% fees are applied on the option payoffs and paid to the Moret token address. The voting process takes place for 30 days and 50% threshold of total balance at proposal time is needed to change the fees.
2. Add and remove liquidity pools. Anyone can deploy new liquidity pools. Voting process is needed to add new liquidity pools or remove existing ones. As above, 30-day voting period is required. 25% threshold is used for adding new liquidity pool while 50% is needed for removing existing pools.&#x20;
