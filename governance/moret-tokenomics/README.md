# Moret Tokenomics

Moret tokens are distributed initially to developers and investors. When the total values locked in any liquidity pool, net of any collaterals and unpaid profits, pass US$ 1 million and is higher than other pools for the same token, LP tokens can be exchanged with Moret tokens based on the total values locked. In return, the Moret governance protocol itself holds the liquidity pool tokens, in a similar way to DeFi 2.0, all the while collecting the protocol fees when options are exercised.

In the meantime, the initial tokens for developers are only unlocked after the first US$ 1 million landmark is reached.&#x20;

This type of tokenomics has the following benefits compared to the more widely adopted fixed-supply tokenomics.&#x20;

1. While fixed-supply tokenomics fit native tokens nicely as a deflationary currency, the pre-set amount precludes the ever changing economy and adoptions of the DeFi exchanges. The amount of Moret tokens is not fixed at the onset, allowing for future growth.
2. The supply schedule is normally highly skewed to initial contributors and investors, creating an undesired plutocracy within the governance structure. A natural dilution process in the form of exchanging new Moret tokens for liquidity pool tokens allows the ownership to gradually transition from initial contributors to the wider community.
3. The utility of the governance token shouldn't only be limited to setting a couple of parameters on the smart contract. As demonstrated by a few DeFi 2.0 experiments, governance tokens are better off owning liquidity and exposing themselves to the growth of the protocol itself, not quite dissimilar to that of equity holders of a limited company.
