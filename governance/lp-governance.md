# LP Governance

Holders of each of the liquidity pools can govern the pool in the following ways:

1. Register a new hedging strategy by creating a new staked sub-pool, or hot tub, with a specific address allowed to run the hedging bot.&#x20;
2. Set the fees for exercising options, initially set to 0.5% of option payoffs to exercising bot.
