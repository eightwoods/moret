# Crypto Options Landscape

The current crypto options landscape is dominated by Deribit which controls vast majority of trading volumes. On the DeFi space, many protocols have joined the game with various innovations. Moret's aim is to provide better solutions on five aspects:&#x20;

* Decentralisation and mutualised ownership by liquidity providers
* Volatility trading via tokens
* Enhanced tail liquidity based on auto-RFQ process joining liquidity pools and market makers.
* Under-collateralisation made possible by put and call spread as single contracts, and liquidity pool tokens used as collateral
* Capital efficiency for liquidity providers as impermanent loss is greatly reduced.
