# Moret: Option exchange

Moret is an on-chain exchange for trading crypto options. Running on-chain brings much benefits  as custody-free, total transparency and smart-contract-level security. Anyone could trade options on Ethereum and Bitcoin prices with their USDC on the Polygon chain which provides a low-cost environment critical for derivatives trading. Moret provides similar range of options to Deribit and much more flexibility than other DeFi protocols.
