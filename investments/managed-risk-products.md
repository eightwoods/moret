# Managed Risk Products

Moret will provide a range of managed risk products that aim to limit the downside risk of crypto investment. These products will automatically invest in options and roll forward when these options expire.&#x20;

#### Rolling Put&#x20;

This strategy invests in a crypto currency and its long-term put options with strike prices at 15% or 20% lower than the market price. They then automatically roll forward the options when they expire.&#x20;

With Rolling Put, the loss of the investment will never be more than the difference between strike and initial price, therefore providing protection to the crypto investment

#### Low-cost Rolling Put

This strategy builds on the Rolling Put. An additional feature is added by selling another put option with strike price at 30% or 50% of initial market price. Selling options create income for the investors which reduces the total cost of the Rolling Put. Also a decrease of 50% in price is relatively infrequent. Even when the huge drop does happen, the strategy will still outperform the naked position in the crypto asset.

#### Zero-cost Rolling Put

One step further from the low-cost strategy is the zero-cost Rolling Put where an additional call option is sold, so to make the total cost of the strategy zero. This is ideal for investors averse to huge volatility both on the up and down side.
